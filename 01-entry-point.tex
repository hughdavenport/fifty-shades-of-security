\chapter{Entry Point}

She had never seen a rainbow table that large before. it was beautifully
indexed before her, all she had to do was reach out and grab it. The table
bulged with data and begged for use, though she wanted to find the owner
of the table first. She wandered around the room looking for this
mysterious man, and then just around the corner she saw the tip of a black
hat poking over the top of a rugged screen.

She walked around the corner and as she saw him her heart raced as he
fingered the keyboard with skill and dexterity. She instantly felt a
connection and saw a future with this wild stranger. He heard her footsteps
and looked up. He stepped up and wandered towards her. As he began
exploiting her vulnerabilities, a grin crept upon his face. His XSS was
just the beginning.

She sat down at the computer next to him. With a smile he released his
rootkit into her harddrive. She never saw the trojan horse coming. It was
already engorged when it reached her firewall.

His rapid timing attack was almost too much for her to handle. She would've
liked it slow, she wanted to make the fun last longer. He went and did a
brute force attack and only took minutes to get past her firewall.
